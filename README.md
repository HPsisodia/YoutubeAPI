# YoutubeAPI
An API to get the details of a youtube playlist and its videos by entering the playlistId



Get a "Youtube Data Api V3" Key form google developer console i.e https://console.developers.google.com/

Replace the "apikey" empty string in playlist controller with your api key

Do a "npm i" to install all the dependencies

Start a local mongoDb server with your command line

Run "npm start" to start the project at your localhost 3000

Now you can run the post api at localhost:3000/api/playlist with curl or postman, giving your youtube playlistId in the body under the keyword "playlistId"



P.S: An uncompleted React Frontend is also added, will work on it when i get some time
